NAME
    `Net::Async::Gearman' - use Gearman with IO::Async

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides an IO::Async-based wrapper around
    Protocol::Gearman. It shouldn't be used directly; see instead

    * Net::Async::Gearman::Client

METHODS
  $gearman->connect( %args ) ==> ( $gearman )
    Connects to the server. Takes the same arguments as IO::Async::Handle's
    `connect' method, but additionally sets a default service name of port
    4730.
